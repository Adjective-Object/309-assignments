#Assignment 2: Breakout
c3huangk/g3gohnic

An implementation of the game breakout for A2 of CSC309 Fall 2014.

AMI ID: <not yet created>  
works in chrome, untested in firefox.  

The apache server should be running by default. If not, run
`sudo apachectl start`

If for some reason the wrong assignment is being 
showed  on the server, run
`/home/ubuntu/309-assignments/a2/setupwww`
which should copy the relevant files to the apache www/html folder.
